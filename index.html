    <p>The example above is a real and common case where elements are displayed after the page loads.</p>
    <p>In this situation we have to inform explicitely the web driver to wait for the elements before interacting with
        them. WDI will automatically perform basic checks before interacting with the elements and in a lot of cases he
        does not
        need more information.</p>
